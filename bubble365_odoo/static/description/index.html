		<h1>Embedded Telephony Integration for Odoo</h1>

		<p>
			Connecting the Odoo embedded integration to your telephony environment is hugely important for improving customer
			satisfaction and working more efficiently. With integration tool Bubble, during an incoming or outgoing phone
			call, you no longer have to look for customer details manually, but they appear directly in a Odoo pop-up
			notification.
			From there, you can perform various actions such as opening a customer card.
		</p>

		<h2>Embedded Pop-up Notification</h2>

		<p>
			Bubble has a number of unique features. This integration ensures that you immediately get all relevant customer
			data on a phone call. From the overview that appears, which can be fully customised per user, department or
			company, you can instantly take the desired action. When transferring a call to a colleague, the customer
			information moves with it. By default, the pop-up notification in Odoo is visible from the moment your softphone,
			desk phone, or other device rings until the call ends.
		</p>

		<h2>Functionalities</h2>

		<p>
			In addition to the above-mentioned pop-up notification capabilities, Bubble is equipped with many more
			functionalities. If you also use other applications, you can even show CRM information or buttons from those
			applications inside the integration, if desired. Below are some of the most important functions:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Call Control:</strong> Control your desk phone, softphone or other device directly from Odoo (provided
				your telephony platform supports it).</li>
			<li><strong>Search Bar:</strong> Easily search CRM contact data and perform the desired action (call, WhatsApp,
				Teams chat, email, etc.).</li>
			<li><strong>Call Waiting:</strong> Quickly switch between multiple pop-up notifications of incoming calls.</li>
			<li><strong>Multi Result:</strong> If multiple relations are known under one number, you can browse through the
				results.</li>
			<li><strong>Call History:</strong> View all contact moments with the phone number over the last 90 days, including
				the last colleague who made contact.</li>
			<li><strong>Call Logging:</strong> After each call, a call log is automatically pushed to the CRM so the
				interaction is saved under the customer card.</li>
			<li><strong>Theme Modes:</strong> Choose between light and dark modes to suit your personal preference or company
				branding.</li>
			<li><strong>Single Sign-On:</strong> Secure and simple login using Microsoft, Google, or Apple accounts.</li>
		</ul>
